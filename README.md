This repository demonstrates a common data race error in Rust when dealing with vectors and unsafe code. The `bug.rs` file contains the buggy code, which modifies a vector using a raw pointer without proper synchronization, potentially leading to unexpected behavior and data corruption in a multithreaded environment. The `bugSolution.rs` file provides a corrected version, illustrating safe and synchronized ways to handle concurrent vector access.
